        Pausing the timeline on b_text is not strictly necessary for this example to run.

        the robot will stop getting new commands and the cube will stop updating without needing to
        pause at all.  The reason that the timeline is paused here is to prevent the robot being carried
        forward by momentum for a few frames after the physics subscription is canceled.  Pausing here makes
        this example prettier, but if curious, the user should observe what happens when this line is removed.
